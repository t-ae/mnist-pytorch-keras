# PyTorch vs Keras

Compare [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/).

Train MNIST for one epoch.

Python 3.6.1

## Differences

### Loss function
`mnist_keras.py` uses `categorical_crossentropy` as loss function.

On the other hand, PyTorch does not have equivalent function. So I calculate it by myself.

```python
loss = -out.gather(1, label).log().mean()
```

By the way, in PyTorch, it is common to use `CrossEntropy` which uses `LogSoftmax`.  
This repository contains both versions of them(`mnist_pytorch.py` and `mnist_pytorch_logsoftmax.py`).
